	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm interested in cosmology, galaxy formation and evolution, and the first stars in the universe. I have been at 
	the Georgia Institute of Technology since August 2017, in pursuit of my Phyiscs Ph.D.</p> 
	<p>I received my Bachelors of Science from the University of Washington in Seattle with a double major in Physics and Astronomy and a double minor in Mathematics
  	and Philosophy. </p>
	
	<p>My first day in graduate school, I volunteered to help out with Georgia Tech's solar eclipse event.</p>
	<p> Here is an image with my parents and I from that day!: <img src="Eclipse.jpg" /></p>
